                    <p>The web is changing. The days are gone when we could simply just design for desktop and laptop computers and maybe tack on a mobile stylesheet. Now our websites need to work on a staggering variety of screen resolutions. From the high definition, large display monitors on the desktop, down to smart phones such as the iPhone, Android and Blackberry, your website just needs to work. Responsive Web Design uses a combination of CSS3 media queries, flexible grids and images to dynamically respond to the user's display preferences, instead of forcing the user to conform to our design. Marc will give a presentation on why we should now be designing our sites for mobile first and then adapting our sites for more capable browsers with larger resolutions using responsive web design techniques. He will also share his thoughts about when to think about creating an app and when responsive web design is a better choice.</p>

                    <p>From div to span, every element has it's place and meaning in HTML. Well, ok, maybe not marquee or blink but that's besides the point. Anthony Ticknor has spent more than a decade cultivating his knowledge of each element and it's correct use. His presentation will cover the history &amp; importance of semantics in our websites, the document outline, what the future holds for us, and the role semantics play in crafting a better web for everyone.</p>

Sam Carlton has been working with them since they first hit the scene, and after a quick introduction to the basic usage of LESS and SASS,  his presentation will focus around how you can use them to simplify the mobile-first approach, have more fun with media-queries, and own the responsive grid.</p>

                    <p>If you’re using responsive web design, one of the biggest challenges is how to handle images. Having images change size based on the layout is the easy part. The hard part is optimizing the quality and download size of images when they change size. Marc Drummond will review several approaches to handling responsive images, including the proposed picture element and srcset attribute. We will also take a look at resizing background images, compressing retina graphics and how to determine which breakpoints and sizes to use for your images. If you are interested in attending, please make sure to “respond”!</p>
